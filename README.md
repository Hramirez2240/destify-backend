## Description

This is the backend side of the movies application

## How to run the project locally

To run the project you need to do this quick things:

1. Clone the repository
2. After you cloned the repository you need to install the project's dependencies using this command in your terminal:
```bash
$ npm i
```
3. After the installation of all the dependencies you need to create a .env file in the root of the project and configure with the values that I sent to the email
4. After you do this steps, you can visit http://localhost:3001/api with no problems.

PD: I also sent the postman collection just in case you want to see all the endpoints
